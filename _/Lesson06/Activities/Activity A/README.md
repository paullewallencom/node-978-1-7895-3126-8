# Factory Pattern: Language Detection

We'd like you to create a really crude application that reads `Hello` from the console after it is started and interprets that greeting.

It will then print back the language that it has detected.

Use a factory pattern to return back the correct language detected. 

For the purposes of this exercise you can stick to the following languages:

* English - hello 
* French - bonjour
* Spanish - ola
* German - hallo
* Japanese - konnichiwa
* Chinese - ni hao

For example, if you start the application it will listen for input on the terminal.

Type `konnichiwa` in the terminal and it should response `Japanese Language Detected`
